# Screen Assistant

Screen Assistant is a chrome extension chatbot that follows you around the web. It can read what you're looking at and provide insights and answer questions about whatever's on your screen.

That's pretty much it! Have fun.

## Usage

You must provide your own OPENAI api key, which you can paste into the chat box when you first open the extension. You API Key is only stored locally.
